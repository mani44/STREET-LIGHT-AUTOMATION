# STREET-LIGHT-AUTOMATION

By using Smart Street light, one can save surplus amount of energy which
is done by replacing sodium vapor lamps by LED and adding an
additional feature for security purposes. It prevents unnecessary wastage
of electricity, caused due to manual switching of streetlights when itâ€™s not
required. It provides an efficient and smart automatic streetlight control
system with the help of IR sensors. It can reduce the energy consumption
and maintains the cost. The system is versatile, extendable and totally
adjustable to user needs.

further extended to make the current system in two-way traffic, making
the system more flexible in case of rainy days and introduction of ways to
control the lights through GSM based service.
